Code Giveaway Wordpress Plugin
======

This is an old WordPress plugin that was created for the simple task of handing out unique keys to registered readers. It allowed for the adminsitrator to create a distrubtion campaign and populate the database with codes. After creation of the camapign, a shortcode becomes available that allows the campaign to be applied to any page on the website. At the time of its creation, it was the only complete key & code distribution plugin for the WordPress platform. 

The plugin was created in 2011 as an experiment, and I **do not recommend using it in any production enviroment today**. The code was very rough when it was published, and I do not consider it to be up regular standard.
